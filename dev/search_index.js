Dimension of problem and Number of points discovered by inspection of point cloud.\n\nThis method uses the Khachiyan algorithm, solving the dual problem in N+1 dimensions.\n\nKhachiyan 1996 is pretty impenetrable: http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jagm.1996.0062 But these slides (see page 17) are fairly understandable: https://people.orie.cornell.edu/miketodd/ublndeta.pdf\n\nhere I use variable names as in the above talk.\n\nIt was implemented with considerable assistance by reading J.Cumby's source code for PIEFACE: https://github.com/jcumby/PIEFACE/blob/372b6ff6166e4996d86084a3116a8b606c25acfa/pieface/ellipsoid.py#L54-L71 Nb: Python/Numpy has crazy definiton of dotproduct = matrix multiplication. 8-[\n\nCumby's Python implementation seems heavily influenced by Nina Moshtagh's Matlab implementation: https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9542-minimum-volume-enclosing-ellipsoid https://doi.org/10.1.1.116.7691\n\nMy implementation follows Moshtagh closely, as I find the code  well documented & the Matlab syntax is very close to Julia.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
